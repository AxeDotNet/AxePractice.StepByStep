         * Now we will create a framework just like the ASP.NET WebApi. We called

         * And the most important type for generating response is the HttpController.
         * In this practice, we try invoking the specified action of the controller
         * to generate a response.
         * 
         * The class to invoke controller action is called a ControllerActionInvoker,
         * and the entry point is called InvokeAction. It accepts an actionDescriptor
         * which contains the instance of the controller (currently we have no idea
         * where it comes from), the name of the action to invoke. For simplicity,
         * we assume that all actions contains no parameter.
